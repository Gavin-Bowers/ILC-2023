## What type of threat is perhaps most uniquely, given the nature of it, a risk in a research project like SETI@Home, and how might that threat materialize?

In a distributed research project like SETI@Home, an attacker could potentially send false data to poison the data. Alternatively, an attacker could attempt an attack on the servers, like a DDoS attack. Not sure why anyone would attack Seti@home... anti-alien activists?

## What are zero-day attacks and why are they a threat?

Zero-day attacks are attacks which exploit vulnerabilities which aren't known about publicly. Zero day attacks are hard to defend against because defenders aren't aware of the vulnerability's existence or how to prevent it from being exploited.

## What is port scanning and how is it a threat?

Port scanning is a technique which attempts to connect to many different ports on a server. Port scanning can be used to find services running on servers which can serve as points of entry for an attacker.

## What are supercookies? Via what means do we most commonly obtain/receive them, and how do they create threats to our systems?

Supercookies refer to a number of techniques which track users across sites by identifying their device. Supercookies typically use http headers or cache data to accomplish this. They are used to identify a user across sites, which can compromise anonymity and allow the user's behavior to be profiled.

## What makes a worm distinct from a virus?

A worm is a kind of virus which is capable of replicating itself and spreading beyond the initially infected device. An example of this was a worm on the Discord messaging platform, which would steal a user's Discord token, and use the account access to send messages to their contacts, attempting to phish them and spread further.

## Provide a technological example of "security through obscurity".

Many US nuclear launch facilities use very old computer hardware and software in part because of security through obscurity. An attacker would need the right tools and expertise to even attempt an attack on these computers.

## Distinguish the concepts of SSH and VPN.

SSH (secure shell) is an encrypted protocol for securely accessing a server remotely. A VPN (virtual private network) is an encrypted network protocol for routing internet access through a server. VPNs are used to obfuscate the user's IP. You can use SSH through a VPN.

## What purpose does the X.509 standard serve?

The X.509 standard outlines the standards for public key encryption which is used for TLS among other things. TLS is the basis for HTTPS.

## Why might a company's security team practice penetration testing ("pen testing")?

A company security team might practice pen testing in order to be able to test the resistance to attack of their own systems.

## Of the below HTTP status codes, which most likely suggests that a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack may be occurring?
