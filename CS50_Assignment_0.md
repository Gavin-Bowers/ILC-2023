### What does it mean to be authenticated but not authorized to access some web page?

If a user is authenticated but not authorized to access a web page, it means that the web server has confirmed the identity of the user, but that user doesn't have permission to access the web page in question.
### If I have a six-character password consisting of uppercase (English) letters and (decimal) digits only, how many seconds might it take an adversary to crack, assuming they make one attempt per second?

### Humor us for a moment, and play The Password Game, trying to get through at least Rule 12.

### While obviously the game itself is in many ways meant to be humorous, it also critiques the experience many of us have setting up new passwords. Explain how there's a trade-off between usability and security in the context of passwords.

Many features that enhance the security of a password - such as requiring special characters, numbers, and upper case letters, or having a minimum length - make passwords harder to type and harder to remember. Passwords which are more secure are less usable.
### Consider the below comic for the next two questions.
Source: xkcd.com/936/
### Consider the top row of the comic above. Why are passwords like those easy (for a computer) to guess but hard (for a human) to remember?

Passwords like Tr0ubador&3 are easy for computers to guess because the number of possible passwords in that style is small. There aren't that many possible passwords in the space of passwords based on a common word with common substitution of numbers and an appended special character.
### Now consider the bottom row of the comic above. Why are passwords like those hard (for a computer) to guess but easy (for a human) to remember?

Passwords like correct horse battery staple are hard to guess for computers because there are many common English words and the number of random 4 word sequences is astronomically large. These passwords are easy to remember because they can be imagined as a story or scene, something much easier to memorize.
### What does it mean if a website "leaks" information? What sort of information might a (poorly designed) website actually leak in practice?

A website leaks information if it exposes information to users without the authorization to see it. An example of this is the gaming platform Steam once accidentally exposed user details of other users to those using the Steam store. These details included phone numbers, emails, billing addresses, and purchase histories. This could be considered a data breach since the issue resulted from a DDoS attack on Steam's servers. However, since data was exposed to users and not the attacker and accessing the data was not the intent of the attack, I think it qualifies as a leak.
### Provide an example of something that would be considered a knowledge factor.

A password is an example of a knowledge factor.
### Provide an example of something that would be considered an inherence factor.

A fingerprint is an example of an inherence factor.
### Why are phishing attacks so difficult to prevent?

Phishing attacks are difficult to prevent because email doesn't have robust systems for verifying the authenticity of a message. Users rely on the text and visual content of emails, as well as the email address, to determine authenticity. Lookalike email addresses can be created using the large character set available in the email standard, and skilled actors can faithfully recreate the appearance of emails from banks, bosses, subscriptions services, etc.
### Suppose that your boss's boss asks you whether the company should require use of password managers for all employees.

### Explain in a short paragraph why you might want everyone in the company to use a password manager. 

A password manager has many advantages. It prevents employees from forgetting passwords and getting locked out. It also provides a secure way of sharing passwords from device to device, or between employees. A password manager also makes it easy to use more secure passwords, given that they can be longer, more complex, and more random. A password manager can also randomly generate secure passwords.
